# cs162-final

The program designed for this final project is "achievement_display.py". It takes a Steam game ID (found in the game's URL: https://store.steampowered.com/app/STEAM_GAME_ID/STEAM_GAME_NAME/) and provides two outputs. The first is a graphical display of each achievement in the game, along with the global percentage of players who have unlocked this achievement. The second is a text file that neatly displays these achievements and percentages in a list.
